# GoTrip ~ A Complete Tour Plan Solution.
Here's the corrected version of your project description:

This was a project from my undergraduate course CSE299 (Junior Project Design). For it, we developed a website for people who love to travel. The main goal of this website was to provide tourists with proper guidelines and insights into different tourist places in Bangladesh. The main features of the website included:

1.  A sign-in and sign-up interface for user accounts.
2.  Various tour package options to choose from, mainly categorized by "Popular Places", "Archaeological Places" and "One Day Trip"
3.  An online payment option to purchase any desired package.
